Alternatively, you can use  
`file:///C:/Users/<username>/AppData/Roaming/TS3Client/plugins/pyTSon/scripts/socketplugin/Web-Overlay/index.html`  
as a URL to make the webpage independant from the server, this helps when you don't want to reload the source every time OBS starts before the server. If the correct checkbox is set, this can be fixed by toggling visiblity of the source, which refreshes the page.
